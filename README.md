# Sentiment Analysis of Dell Tweets

## Overview

This project analyzes tweets related to **Dell products** to classify them into **positive, negative, or neutral sentiments** using **natural language processing (NLP)** and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide **insights into customer sentiment** and help Dell improve customer satisfaction by identifying common emotions like **happiness, frustration, and excitement**.

## Objectives

- **Data Exploration (EDA):** Analyze trends and patterns in sentiment and emotion distribution.
- **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess textual data for feature extraction.
- **Model Training:** Implement various **machine learning** and **deep learning** models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Insights & Recommendations:** Provide actionable findings based on sentiment trends.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of **tweets related to Dell**, labeled with sentiment categories. The preprocessing steps include:

- Removing URLs, numbers, and special characters.
- Tokenization and stopword removal.
- Lemmatization to convert words to their root form.
- Feature engineering using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec**.

## Methodology

### 1. Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Captures word importance in the corpus.
- **Word2Vec**: Generates dense word embeddings for semantic understanding.

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple and efficient baseline model.
- **Random Forest**: Captures complex word relationships with an ensemble approach.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for high-dimensional text data.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model well-suited for text classification.

### 3. Deep Learning Models
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Processes text sequentially.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Handles long-range dependencies in text.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Leverages pre-trained language models for high-performance sentiment analysis.

## Results

| Model                  | Accuracy  | F1 Score |
|------------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression (TF-IDF) | 75%  | 0.75 |
| Random Forest (TF-IDF) | 73%  | 0.73 |
| SVM (TF-IDF) | 75%  | 0.75 |
| RNN (TF-IDF) | 70%  | 0.72 |
| LSTM (TF-IDF) | 75%  | 0.73 |
| LSTM (Word2Vec) | 72.6%  | 0.74 |
| BERT + Word2Vec | **80.5%**  | **0.79** |

- **BERT (Word2Vec) outperformed all models with an accuracy of 80.5%**, leveraging deep contextual embeddings.
- **TF-IDF models consistently outperformed Word2Vec in traditional machine learning**.
- **Deep learning models like LSTM and BERT provided strong performance**, but require more computational power.

## Key Insights

- **Negative sentiment tweets** often mention words like **"problem," "bad," and "overheating"**, suggesting common issues with Dell products.
- **Positive sentiment tweets** highlight **"performance," "speed," and "battery life."**
- **Neutral sentiment tweets** mainly include **product inquiries, price comparisons, and general mentions.**
- **Word clouds** helped visualize the most frequently used words per sentiment category.
- **Sentiment trends over time** showed spikes in negative sentiment during product launches or technical issues.

## Future Improvements

- **Fine-tune BERT** for better classification.
- **Incorporate additional metadata**, such as tweet location and engagement metrics.
- **Explore real-time sentiment tracking** for Dellâ€™s social media presence.

## Conclusion

This project provides **valuable sentiment insights for Dell** using **machine learning and deep learning**. With **BERT's superior performance**, this approach can be used in **customer feedback systems, automated support, and product improvement strategies**.
